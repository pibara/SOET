# Smashwords OpenDyslexic Epub Template
This repository contains a currently still experimental epub template aimed at authors who want to realease a dyslexia friendly version of their fiction.
This template uses an embedded OpenDyslexic font and has a css that specifies a default character of 24p with a 1.6 line spacing. With this it aims to allow Smaswords authors to create dyslexia friendly versions of their eBooks and publish them using the Smashwords Direct program.
